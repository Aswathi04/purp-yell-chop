### Project Description
A website where you can write your emotions out of your system but won't let you reminisce them cause it will be gone before you know it!
### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
The need to write my frustrations out without having to worry about my sane version reading about it later on and then feeling guilty for being mean.

You get it out, we smash it out of the park. Nothing is saved, no looking backs.
